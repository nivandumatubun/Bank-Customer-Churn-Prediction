# Bank Customer Churn Prediction
## Backgorund
A bank has 10,000 customers, of which 2037 customers (around 20%) churn. However, banks do not know what factors influence customer churn and customer characteristics that have the potential to cause greater churn.

## Goal
Reducing or lowering the churn rate.

## Objective
1. Identify factors that influence customers to churn
2. Build accurate machine learning (ML) models that can predict customers who have the potential to churn based on existing factors

## Business Metric
Churn Rate (percentage of customers who churn)
